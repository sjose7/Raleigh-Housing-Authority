  			The HOPE VI Grant Program was implemented in 1993 by the Department of Housing and Urban Development as a result of recommendations by the National Commission on Severely Distressed Public Housing. The goal of the HOPE VI Grant Program is to eradicate dilapidated public housing and replace it with mixed-income, mixed-use revitalized communities. The HOPE VI grant program is a highly selective, highly competitive program.  Usually, only 20 – 25% of housing authorities applying for the grant will be successful in receiving a grant award

  			The Raleigh Housing Authority received its first HOPE VI grant in the amount of $29,368,114 in 1999 to demolish and revitalize Halifax Court. Halifax Court was Raleigh’s oldest and most dilapidated public housing complex. It's demolition and planned revitalization has already sparked neighborhood renewal.
